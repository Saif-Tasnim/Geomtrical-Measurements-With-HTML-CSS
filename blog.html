        <h2 class="text-center">Q : What is DOM? Purpose Of DOM </h2>
        <h2 class="mt-3 text-decoration-underline">Ans : </h2>
        <p class="mt-2 fs-6">The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page. A web page is a document that can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. In both cases, it is the same document but the Document Object Model (DOM) representation allows it to be manipulated. As an object-oriented representation of the web page, it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript. </p>
 

        <p>The main reasons for developing the DOM is to maintain a standard programming interface for HTML and XML documents, which is language-independent. Setting and maintaining this standard enables programmers to create or navigate these types of documents and modify their elements predictably, using any type of language or development environment.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center">Q : How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods. </h2>
        <h2 class="mt-3 text-decoration-underline">Ans : </h2>
        <p class="mt-2 fs-6"> There are 5 Ways to select HTML elements using DOM methods.
        The 5 ways are written below: </p>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>getElementsByTagName() </li>
            <li> getElementsByClassName() </li>
            <li> getElementById() </li>
            <li> querySelector() </li>
            <li> querySelectorAll() </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="text-center">Q :  What is event bubble? </h2>
        <h2 class="mt-3 text-decoration-underline">Ans : </h2>
        <p class="mt-2 fs-6"> Event bubbling is a method of event propagation in the HTML DOM API when an event is in an element inside another element, and both elements have registered a handle to that event. It is a process that starts with the element that triggered the event and then bubbles up to the containing elements in the hierarchy. In event bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements. </p>

        <h2 class="text-center">Q : What is a callback function and why will you use it? </h2>
        <h2 class="mt-3 text-decoration-underline">Ans : </h2>
        <p class="mt-2 fs-6">A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action. </p>
 

        <p>We need callback functions because many JavaScript actions are asynchronous, which means they don't really stop the program (or a function) from running until they're completed, as you're probably used to. Instead, it will execute in the background while the rest of the code runs.</p>
